```bash
npm install ambush
yarn add ambush
pnpm add ambush
bun add ambush
```

## Importing

const ab = require('ambush');

// ES Modules
import ab from 'ambush';
```

Ambush supports a diverse range of data types, including strings, arrays, and objects. Ensuring a good grasp of JavaScript fundamentals can be quite enjoyable and empowering for your coding journey. It lays a strong foundation for fun and creative programming adventures!
