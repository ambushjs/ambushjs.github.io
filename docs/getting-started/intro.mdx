# Introduction

Welcome to [Ambush][ambush], your go-to utility [npm][npm] package for simplifying complex tasks in [Node.js][node]. In comparison to alternatives such as [Lodash][lodash] and [Underscore.js][underscore], Ambush prioritizes performance and is tailored to enhance your development experience while keeping things lean and efficient.

---

Get started with Ambush by setting up the environment. You will need [Node.js][node] v14.0.0 or newer before installing with your preffered package manager.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm install ambush
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add ambush
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add ambush
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Importing

You can `import` or `require()` this package using a name of your preference, typically 'ab', or you can opt for object destructuring when working with a specific module:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cjs" label="CommonJS">

```js
const ab = require('ambush');
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="esm" label="ES Modules">

```js
import ab from 'ambush';
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
