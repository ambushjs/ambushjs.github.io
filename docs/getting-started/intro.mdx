# Introduction

Welcome to **Ambush**, your go-to utility [npm](https://npmjs.com) package for simplifying complex tasks in [Node.js](node). In comparison to alternatives such as [Lodash](https://npmjs.com/package/lodash) and [Underscore.js](https://npmjs.com/package/underscore), Ambush prioritizes performance and is tailored to enhance your development experience while keeping things lean and efficient.

---

Get started with Ambush by setting up the environment. You will need [Node.js][node] v14.0.0 or newer before installing with your preffered package manager.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install ambush
```
